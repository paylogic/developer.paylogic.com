Peter Odding
============

Peter is the team lead of the operational IT team. His day to day job is a
combination of devops, team management, contact with other departments in
Paylogic and contact with external parties (technology partners).

He started programming when he was twelve and he has a passion for automation
and packaging. If it can be automated he'll do it at some point :-). You can
contact him through `his Twitter account <http://twitter.com/peterodding>`_ or
by sending him an `e-mail <peter@peterodding.com>`_.

Òscar Vilaplana
===============

Òscar is one of Paylogic's architecture team. He's currently working on the Paylogic's new API that will allow third parties to sell tickets through Paylogic in their own sites and apps. He is a passionate of clear, simple and well designed code.

When he is not coding or designing software or reading books about it he is probably biking around on my recumbent bike, messing around with improv comedy or desecrating old master's works on his piano.

Find him on Twitter as `@grimborg <http://twitter.com/grimborg>`_, check out his `blog <http://oscarvilaplana.cat>`_ or drop him a line on `<dev@oscarvilaplana.cat>`_.
