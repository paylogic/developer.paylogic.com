About the development portal
############################

The Paylogic development portal was created as a portal between the technical
teams working at Paylogic and the rest of the (tech) world. This site is
published using Pelican_, a static site generator written in Python. Pelican
allows us to write our articles in reStructuredText_ and given our experience
with both Python and reStructuredText, what's not to love?

About Paylogic International
############################

Paylogic offers event organizers high end technological solutions for them to
gain full control over ticket sales (strategies) and access management. Full
ownership of customer data is provided on a no cure no pay basis, and the
company is specialized in handling `peak sales`_ and `event specific seating
solutions`_.

The platform of Paylogic exists out of online ticket shops that can be
integrated in the event’s website but it also enables ticket sales through
Apple Passbook and social media channels like Facebook. Other (marketing)
platforms of premium media channels in countries where Paylogic operates, are
integrated in the Paylogic system. Through this approach a wide range of
audiences to target is offered and all statistics are available real time.

Event organizers can make use of Customer Services for their visitors as well
as professional Event Services with scan and box office solutions enabling
sales and access management both prior and during the event. Paylogic
additionally provides dedicated account management services to assist event
organizers in strengthening the relationship with their visitors.
