Introducing the Paylogic developer portal
#########################################

Welcome to the Paylogic developer portal! This website is a platform for
communication between the engineers & devops at Paylogic and the world (you!).
We use this website to share:

- Articles about technical topics involving programming (testing, design,
  architecture) and system administration (high availability, automation,
  performance testing) and community events like PyGrunn_

- Open source projects we've published (see also our GitHub_ account)

In the future this website will also host the documentation of the Paylogic
ticketing API which is currently under development.
