Spyros is working as a software engineer in Paylogic. He is a firm believer of
the idea that software engineering is not just a craftsmanship, which has something
to do with computers. Software engineering is about collaboration and communication
between groups of people to solve real-life problems by using innovative technologies.
That is why he enjoys doing it. Besides computers though, Spyros likes to go out
with friends, watch movies, play piano, do improv comedy, and study and learn
about new technologies.
